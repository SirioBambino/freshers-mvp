# Dependency Management

This document outlines the dependency management strategy for the [Cleaner Hire PWA](/README.md), focusing on maintaining stable and secure dependencies critical for PWA performance and security.

## 1. Initial Development Phase

During the prototype and early development stages, all dependencies are pinned to specific versions in `package.json`. This approach prevents issues from unintended version upgrades and ensures consistent dependency resolution across [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environment-variables.md).

## 2. Automated Dependency Updates

As the project stabilises, a solution to automate dependency updates should be implemented. The solution should perform following tasks:

- Monitor the project for outdated or insecure dependencies.
- Automatically generate PRs for dependency updates.
- Group related updates into a single PR to reduce noise.
